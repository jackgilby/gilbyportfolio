				<h2 class="titleText">Quake</h2>
				<p class="text">Quake is a first person shooter that was released by id Software in 1996 and the first game in the popular Quake series of video games. In the game, players must find their way out of various maze-like, medieval environments while battling a variety of monsters using a wide array of guns. The successor to id’s DOOM series, Quake built upon the technology and gameplay of DOOM, offering full real-time 3D rendering, early support for 3D acceleration through OpenGL and adding various multiplayer options. Online multiplayer became increasingly common, with the QuakeWorld update and software such as QuakeSpy making the process of finding and playing against other competitors on the Internet far easier and more reliable. Various multiplayer mods were developed including Team Fortress and Capture the flag.</p>
